# Introduction

Hi! I'm **Zhang Yuzhe**, a student in the *Software Maintenance and Evolution* course.  
I expect to learn a lot about modern software maintenance practices and how to work with legacy systems.

- **Fun fact**: I love playing the guitar in my free time.  
- **Course expectations**: To gain hands-on experience in maintaining and evolving software.
